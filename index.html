                <p>Welcome to The Void. This is my little explore project that I've been thinking about for a while as a fun thing to code. To explore costs nothing and you may do so as often as you please. At the beginning, there will be very few encounters, but with time, more will appear as The Void grows deeper. Be careful not to tread too deeply. Who knows what you may find lurking within.</p>
                <p>Refreshing the page will mysteriously find you right where you began at the mouth of the forest.</p>
